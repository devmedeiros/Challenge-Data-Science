# Challenge Data Science

In this challenge, they propose that I take the role of a new data scientist hired at Alura Voz. This made-up company is in the phone industry and it needs to reduce the Churn Rate.

For the first week, the goal is to identify clients who are more likely to leave the company, afterwards the idea is to optimize the models to guide the decision-making for the Alura Voz.

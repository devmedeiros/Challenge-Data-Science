# Challenge Data Science

In this challenge, they propose that I take the role of a new data scientist hired at Alura Voz. This made-up company is in the phone industry and it needs to reduce the Churn Rate.

For the first week, the goal is to identify clients who are more likely to leave the company, afterwards the idea is to optimize the models to guide the decision-making for the Alura Voz.

# The Churn Profile

New clients are more likely to churn than old clients.

Customers that use fewer services and products tend to leave the company. Also, when they aren't tied down to a longer contract they seem to be more likely to quit.

Regarding the payment method, clients that churn have a strong preference for electronic checks and usually are spending 13.17 monetary units than the average client that didn't leave.
